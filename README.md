Web Development Experience
I have worked on strengthening my web development skills through hands-on experience in HTML and CSS. Key areas I focused on include:

Basic HTML Structure: Developed a solid understanding of HTML elements, attributes, and document structure to create well-organized web pages.
CSS Styling: Applied CSS for styling and layout, experimenting with different properties to achieve desired visual effects.
Responsive Design Basics: Learned the fundamentals of responsive design, ensuring that web pages were accessible and visually consistent across various devices.
Practice Projects: Completed small projects to apply and reinforce these concepts, building a strong foundation in web development.
These experiences were instrumental in building my confidence and competence in web development.
